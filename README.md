## User Story

## User Experience

The homepage consists of a title, "Note Taker," a description of its purpose, "Take notes with Express," and a "Get Started" button. Upon clicking this button, the user is shown a field in which they may enter their notes and a list of note titles on the left, which, upon click, will display the note belonging to that title. Users may click an upper righthand pencil icon to start a new note, and, after entering some text, may save their new note by clicking an upper righthand floppy disk icon. Their new note will then be displayed by title in the lefthand list of saved notes. Each saved note button has a trashcan icon which allows the user to delete the note if desired.
